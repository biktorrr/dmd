Deeper into Maritime Data  (DMD)
===
This repository stores the results of a data curation effort done in the context of the DANS Small Data Project Deeper into Maritime Data  (DMD). In this project, we make scans of Muster rolls available and link them to the extracted metadata as presented in the Dutch Ships and Sailors Linked Data Cloud (http://dutchshipsandsailors.nl). This repository stores a number of RDF files in Turtle format that link DSS records to URIs of images. These images are hosted on a private cloud hosting (Dropbox). Also included are the original documentations (in the form of Excel sheets) and SWI-Prolog and ClioPatria rewriting scripts to convert the data in these excel sheets to RDF. 

The images and metadata were produced by Jur Leinenga, the conversion scripts and RDF data by Victor de Boer
